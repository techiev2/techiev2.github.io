<p>Probably one of the most interesting tools, that interested me much when I started out with Javascript was <a href="http://jsperf.com">JSPerf</a> second only to <a href="http://jslint.com">JSLint</a> (and to a smaller extent, <a href="http://jshint.com">JSHint</a>, thanks to an extreme affinity to Crockford's ideals]. The tool built over the Benchmark.js library, provides a <em>visual</em> comparison of parallel implementations to a problem in terms of ops/sec. I could find some <a href="http://code.google.com/p/benchrun/">Benchrun</a>implementations of a solution to this particular issue but for some queer reason, didn't appeal to me so sat down to write one myself, much like the joke on competing standards.</p>

<p>The one pertinent concern according to me at least, is some kind of reporting that <a href="http://speed.pypy.org">Pypy - Speed</a> offers. Graphical, for that is how you figure things out relatively easier irrespective of how much you love the shell and dumb terminal outputs.</p>

<p>There could be two ends to this implementation attempt; either it encompassing the possible ways of actually profiling implementations with a visually comprehensible report or me understanding the nuances of working in a Pythonic manner. A win-win in either case I guess. Created a <a href="https://github.com/techiev2/Spec">rudimentary port</a> stripped out to work with timeit initially, from an existing local repository that provides dis data along with profile/cProfile stats. Suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>TIL that I feel bad that this repository was not available a few years earlier. A python library to work with proteomics pipelines and MS/LC-MS data in addition to some other handy tools. Fork off and contribute if you are into proteomics data and using Python for working with the same. <a href="http://hg.theorchromo.ru/pyteomics">http://hg.theorchromo.ru/pyteomics</a></p>

<p>Do you opine the snake and the apple to be one vicious combination ? Leaving the religious undercurrents aside, here is one more real functional serpent, apple duo that shows a lot of promise. If my memory serves me right, one of our iOS developers told me about this product (<a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/">Pythonista</a>) a few months back. Nice to know that someone has used it extensively and Python is making some inroads into the iOS developers' camp; if not purely for iOS related work, some acceptance at the least. Acceptance as i see is in itself a hard to come by commodity for Python in certain pockets of development. Hope it goes a longer distance.</p>
